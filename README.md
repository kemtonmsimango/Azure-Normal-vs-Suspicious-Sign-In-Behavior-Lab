# Azure-Normal-vs-Suspicious-Sign-In-Behavior-Lab
This lab focuses on understanding user behavior through logs by comparing normal sign in activity with suspicious looking patterns using Microsoft Entra ID and Log Analytics.  The goal is not to attack or exploit anything. The goal is to learn how defenders read logs, establish a baseline, and identify when something does not look right.
